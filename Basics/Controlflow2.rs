/*
Loop labels:
If you have loops within loops, break and continue apply to the innermost loop at that point.
You can optionally specify a loop label on a loop that you can then use with break or continue
to specify that those keywords apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop.
Loop labels must begin with a single quote.

/*
The outer loop has the label 'counting_up, and it will count up from 0 to 2.
The inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9. The first break that doesnâ€™t specify
a label will exit the inner loop only.
The break 'counting_up; statement will exit the outer loop.

Output:

count = 0
remaining = 10
remaining = 9
count = 1
remaining = 10
remaining = 9
count = 2
remaining = 10
End count = 2
